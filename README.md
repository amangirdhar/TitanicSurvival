# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset, `tested.csv`, includes features such as age, sex, and embarked location. The script handles data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Loading**: The Titanic dataset is loaded from `tested.csv`.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Unnecessary columns are removed.
   - Missing values are filled (age with median, embarked with mode).
   - Categorical variables are encoded (sex and embarked).
3. **Model Training**:
   - The data is split into training and testing sets.
   - A Logistic Regression model is trained.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are computed.
5. **Prediction**:
   - Example prediction for a new passenger is provided.

## Files

- `titanic_survival_prediction.py`: Python script containing code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Code Explanation

1. **Loading and Preprocessing Data**:
   - The dataset is loaded and irrelevant columns are dropped.
   - Missing values are handled by filling in with median or mode.
   - Categorical variables are encoded for model compatibility.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Data is split into training and testing sets.
   - A Logistic Regression model is trained and evaluated.
   - Performance metrics include accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

3. **Survival Prediction**:
   - Predict survival for a new passenger based on input features.

## How to Run

1. Ensure required dependencies are installed.
2. Place `tested.csv` in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python titanic_survival_prediction.py
   ```

## Results

The script outputs:
- Accuracy of the model.
- Classification report detailing precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Confusion matrix showing true vs. predicted classifications.
- Survival prediction for an example passenger.

## Notes

- The Logistic Regression model is configured with a maximum of 1000 iterations for convergence.
- Adjust preprocessing steps and model parameters as needed for improved performance.
